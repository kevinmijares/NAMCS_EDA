# NAMCS 2014-2019 – Exploring the Data
## by Kevin Mijares

A few years ago, a friend of mine was working with a NAMCS dataset for her college class. I didn’t know anything about this dataset or her class, but I don’t know why I’ve always found data, data manipulation, and the insights one can draw from it pretty interesting. So I said, “Why not?” 

With that same inspiration a few years later, let’s give this another shot.  First, let’s start off with what the NAMCS data actually is. NAMCS stands for the National Ambulatory Medical Survey, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC). The survey is used to gather information about the use of ambulatory medical care services in the U.S. The data is collected from the physician and contains various details about the patient, the physician, and the care they received. The CDC offers public data sets for each year the survey was conducted, starting from 1973 to 2019. For the sake of not having this be very difficult, I’m going to be working with NAMCS data from 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019.


The workbook used for all the data available is too large to be hosted on github so I will be hosting it elsewhere in the near future. For now, only the controls.xlsx will be hosted on github as it is under the filesize limit.
